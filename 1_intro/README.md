# Course Introduction

In this section we assume you are at the very starting point of coding.

We'll cover:

- Variables, numbers
- String formatting
- User input
- Booleans
- Lists, tuples, sets
- Dictionaries

You can see the [lectures](lectures/) folder for a break down of all the topics and the code in each.

In the [notes](notes/) folder you can download Markdown or PDF cheatsheets to help you remember some key points.
