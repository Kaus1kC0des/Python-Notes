## Addition `+`
Correct uses:
- The use with integers and floats:
`44 + 19.5  # 63.5`
- The use with strings (concatenation):
`"My name is " + "James"`

Incorrect uses:
- Between strings and integers/floats:
`"The correct number is" + 5`
`TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`

## Subtraction `-`
- The use between integers/floats:
`93.1 - 50`

- The use between sets (return elements of set_1 that aren't in set_2):
```python
set_1 = {3, 6, 9, 7, 5}
set_2 = {3, 6, 9, 95}

set_difference = set_1 - set_2  # {5, 7}
```

## Multiplication `*`
- The arithmetic use:
`8 * 5`

- Multiplying data types:
`"Hello " * 2  # Hello Hello `
`[100] * 2  # [100, 100]`
`(100, 1) * 2  # (100, 1, 100, 1)`

## True Division `/`
- The two operands will always result in a float using the `/` operator

Example:
`40 / 2` will result `20.0`

## Floor Division `//`
- Will always round the amount to the closest tenth and result in an integer

Example:
`55 // 3`

## Modulo `%`
- It's based on the Euclidean division ([learn more](https://blog.teclado.com/pythons-modulo-operator-and-floor-division/))
- Start with a **dividend** and a **divisor**
- It's used to get the remainder between the two operands

Example:

The result for `10 % 3` is `1`.


## Exponentiation `**`
`2 ** 3` Can be read as: 2 raised to the power of 3, same as `2 * 2 * 2`.
