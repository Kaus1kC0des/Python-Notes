### Variables
- A variable is a name associated with a value.
- A variable can be named anything, but it has some rules:
    1. It cannot start with an integer
    2. It cannot contain spaces
    3. It can only contain a symbol, which is the underscore

Examples of variable names:
- Correct:
`response`
`top500`
`one_apple`
`first_numbers`
`_usernames`
`_last_`
`current_`


- Incorrect:
`top 500`
`one apple`
`1st_numbers`
`^last_`
`$current`
`response#`

### Strings
A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks:
- Single quotes `''`
or
- Double quotes `""`


- Anything surrounded by the quotation marks indicate a string
- Every opening quote must have a closing quote to form a string
- If opening a string with a single quote, the closing quote must be a single quote as well

Examples:
- Correct:

`"This is a sample string using double quotes"`

`'This is a sample string using single quotes'`

`'This is a normal string'`

`'50 + 51'`

- Incorrect:

`'This string will end here.' From here the continuation is not a string'`

`'This is an Incorrect string"`

`"Same as this one'`

### Integers
An integer is a whole number of any length that can be positive or negative, written without a fractional element.

Example:

`-1` `0` `1` `2` `3` `86400`


### Floats
A float is a number that can be positive or negative written with a fractional element.

Example:

`-100.54` `1.0` `59.1` `10.99`

### Booleans
In Python booleans are a bool data type having two values:

`True`

`False`

### Lists
- A list is an ordered sequential data type
- A list is used to store multiple elements in one place
- A list is created by a pair of square brackets

`shopping_list = ['cereals', 'milk', 'cherries']`

`midterm_grades = [4, 9, 6, 6]`

- A list can contain different data types

`phone_numbers = ['james', 8067366796]`

- Each element in a list holds a position (index) through which it can be accessed

`shopping_list[0]  # cereals`

`shopping_list[1]  # milk`

`shopping_list[2]  # cherries`

### Tuples
- A tuple is very much like a list, however:
  - A tuple is an ordered sequential data type which is **immutable**
- A tuple is created by a sequence of elements separated by a comma
- For better readability, it can be surrounded by parenthesis

Example:

`shopping_list = 'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'`

`midterm_grades = 4, 9, 6, 6`

`phone_numbers = 'james', 8067366796`

`better_readability = ('with', 'parenthesis')`

### Sets
- A set is an **unordered** data type
- Elements of a set cannot be accessed by their indices
- A set is created by a single pair of curly brackets:

`shopping_list = {'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'}`

### Dictionaries
- A dictionary is created by 3 key components:
curly braces, keys and values
- The keys must be a string
- The values can be any other data type

Example:
```
employees = {'ID': 16915, 'name': 'James', 'department': ['Sales', 'Accounting']}
```

- A dictionary is accessed by keys as such:
`employees['name']  # 'James'`
