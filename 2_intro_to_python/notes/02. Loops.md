### Loops
- loops are used to run blocks of code multiple times
- there are two kinds of loops in Python:
    1. while loops
    2. for loops

### The `while` loop
- runs until the given conditional evaluates to `False`

```py
while <condition>:
    <block of code>
```

An example of proper usage of the `while` loop:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0:
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
  counter -= 1
print("Happy New Year!")
```

An example of the `while` loop that will run until the program is manually stopped:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0: # the counter never gets changed, causing the conditional to be always True
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
```

### The `for` loop
- runs a specific number of times
- often used to go over all the elements of an iterable

```py
for <variable> in <iterable>:
    <block_of_code>
```

- an iterable is an object that can be iterated over e.g. a lists

An example of the `for` loop:

```py
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

#### The `range()` function
> lines 65-68 can be changed by showing the syntax as we did before and then using the design to point out each of the arguments
> we can do the same thing to explain lines 70-71
- the `range()` function returns a sequence of integers in a given range
- arguments that are passed to the function are:
    1. `start` - an integer marking the start of a sequence
    2. `stop` - an integer marking the end of a sequence. Important - `range()` returns integers up to `stop-1`
    3. `step` - an integer representing the size of the step i.e. the difference between consecutive integers in a sequence
- the numbers are generated by starting from `start` and incrementing it by `step` until `stop-1` is reached
- the only argument that has to be stated explicitly is the `stop`
- if not specified, Python will implicitly set `start` to 0 and `step` to 1

An example of the `range()` function used in a `for` loop:
> this is quite a simple example, we can go for something more "real lifelike" if needed
```py
for i in range(5):
    print(i) 
```

### The `break` statement
- the `break` statement is used to stop the loop from iterating
- after the loop has been stopped, the program will continue executing from the next line after it

```py
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
    print(counter)
    if counter == 5:
        break #the loop stops running when the counter is equal to 5
    counter += 1
print(f"That's all the numbers from 0 to {counter}!") #after the break, this line is executed
```

### The `continue` statement
- the continue keyword terminates the current iteration and moves onto the next

An example of the `continue` statement being used in a `for` loop:

```py
cars = ["ok", "ok", "ok", "faulty", "ok", "ok"]

for status in cars:
    if status == "faulty":
        print("Found faulty car, skipping...")
        continue

    print(f"This car is {status}.")
    print("Shipping new car to customer!")
```
> should keyword be changed to statement?

### The `pass` statement
- the `pass` statement is used to skip over a part of the code while executing the program
- it is usually used as a placeholder at a place where some code is required from the syntax side, but the code doesn't exist yet

An example of the `pass` statement being used in a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        pass #even if the block is entered nothing will happen because of the pass statement
    print(i)
```

### `else` keyword and `for` loop
- the `else` keyword can be used with `for` loops to check if the loop has finished running without breaking
- the `else` keyword should be indented by the same number of spaces as `for` loop

An example of using the `else` keyword with a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 10:
        break
else:
    print("The loop didn't break!")
```

An example of how not to use the `else` keyword with a `for` loop if you want to achieve the same goal as above:
> we can add a pointer here explaining what the difference is or give students a hint to try and run the code to spot the difference themselves
```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 10:
        break
    else:
        print("The loop didn't break!")
```

### Nested loops:
- loops can be used one inside another, be it `for` or `while` loops, you can mix them in any way
> should the next line be simplified or even removed? The term complexity might confuse some students, although most of them should get the point of faster execution
- nested loops should be avoided when you aim for lower complexity of a program

An example of nested loops in which the matrix of given dimensions is created:
> this might be a boring example and a bit too "math-like" for some students so we can change it if needed
```py
columns = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
matrix = []
for i in range(columns):
  row = []
  for j in range(rows):
    row.append(0)
  matrix.append(row)
print(matrix)
```
