### The `if` statement
- the `if` statement is used to check if a conditional is `True`
- syntax for writing the `if` statement:

```py
if <expr>:
    <statement>
```

- expr is a conditional expression that is being checked
- the statement is a block of code that will be executed if the boolean value of an expression is `True`

An example of proper writing of the `if` statement:

```py
if name == friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

Two examples of incorrect writing of the `if` statement:

> we can add some arrows here pointing to places where the error is made
```py
if name = friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```
```py
if name == friend:
print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

### The `elif` keyword
- used for chaining multiple `if` statements
- Only one of the branch bodies can run: the first one to evaluate to `True`

> we can add a comment in design reminding students that we can chain elifs more than once
```py
if <expr>:
    <first_statement>
elif <expr>:
    <second_statement>
```

An example of proper usage of the `if` and `elif` statements:

> I'm happy with what's currently here, although the two code examples for proper usage and incorrect writing (lines 47 - 70) might end up being a bit long. I'm not sure they're really necessary.

> The reason I say that is because the correct/incorrect versions are basically the same as the correct/incorrect versions you had in the if statement section (line 16), so we could potentially draw an arrow to that?

> I would leave it as is here, and then in the design we can see if these code samples fit well or if we need to shorten them.
```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
```

An example of incorrect writing of the `if` and `elif` statements:
> we can again point at the error when we add design
> should the code be shorter? is there a need for the first two variables and input?
```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
    elif name == relative:
        print(f"{name} is a family member")
```

### The `else` keyword
- used to run a block of code if all the other `if`/`elif` statements have failed before it
- we don't specify a condition with this keyword
- syntax for using the `else` keyword:

> we can add some kind of a reminder that we can also chain elifs before the else
```py
if <expr>:
    <statement>
else:
    <statement>
```

An example of proper usage of the `else` keyword:
> again, is there really a need for lines before the if statement?
```py
name = "John"
if name == "Rolf":
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == "Phil":
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
else:
    print(f"{name} is a stranger")
```

An example of incorrect usage of the `else` keyword:
> same question here as in line 89
```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
    else:
        print(f"{name} is a stranger")
```
