### Unpacking
- unpacking is used to assign values from an iterable to variables in a single statement
- syntax for unpacking:

```py
x, y, z = collection
```

An example of unpacking a list:

```py
example_list = [1,2,3]
a, b, c = example_list
print(a, b, c)
```

### The `enumerate()` method
- the `enumerate()` method is used to retrieve an object containing both element and its index inside the itereable that is being iterated over
- syntax for the `enumerate()` method with unpacking:

```py
for index, element in enumerate(collecion):
    block of code
```

An example of the `enumerate()` method:

```py
collection = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for index, element in enumerate(collection):
    print(f"Index:{index}; Element:{element}")
```

### The `zip()` function
- the `zip()` function is used to combine multiple iterables into a single one
- new iterable is created by joining i-th element of each iterable until the end of the shorter one is reached
> add a callout mentioning that the zip object will be explained later in the course
- the `zip()` function returns a `zip` object
- syntax for the `zip()` function:
> we can explain that more than two collections can be used in zip by adding a diagram
> Show the two lists side by side and then the zipped list underneath both of them, with an arrow coming from each of the top two lists into the corresponding elements.
```py
zip(*iterables)
```

An example of the `zip()` function used on two lists:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
combined = list(zip(numbers, letters))
print(combined)
```
