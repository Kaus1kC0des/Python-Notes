# Python Libraries and Tools

In this section I'll show you some popular Python libraries and tools that you can use to make your project development easier, or to extend your projects.

`pylint` is a **linter**: a tool that checks your code for potential problems before you run it. Another popular linter is `flake8`.

`yapf` is a **formatter**: a tool that takes your Python code and re-writes it so it looks nicer and so that it always has a consistent style. Another popular formatter is `black`.

`mailgun` is a service used to send e-mails to users of your application. In some lectures of this section I cover how to interact with Mailgun to send e-mails when you need to.
