# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This section talks about object-oriented programming in Python. We start off by looking at dictionaries, and how dictionaries are similar to objects--but limited in certain ways.

You can see the complete section in the [video-course](https://go.tecla.do/cpc). Alternatively we also have a long article on [Object-Oriented Programming in Python for beginners](https://blog.teclado.com/introduction-to-object-oriented-programming-in-python/) that you can read.
